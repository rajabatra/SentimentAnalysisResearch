# A Comprehensive Analysis Of Twitter Tweets Using SOTA Models
## TRANSFORMERS, LSTMS, GPT-3.5, AND GPT 4
In a digital world, sentiment analysis is an important tool that can be used to extract emotions from text. This paper explores several methods for deciphering sentiment within Twitter's 280 characters. Utilizing Kaggle’s Sentiment-140 dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140], categorized into positive and negative tweets, our research employs advanced models to interpret Twitter sentiments: Transformers, LSTM’s, GPT 3.5 and GPT 4. We start by exploring the dataset and then detail the construction of the transformer and LSTM models. Our focus then shifts towards investigating the impact of in-context learning and prompt input sequences on foundation models.
